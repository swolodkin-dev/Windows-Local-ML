## How to install/setup/configure basic Python ML tools under MS Windows 10

This procedure will allow you to install, setup & configure all the software needed to run a basic Machine Learning framework utilizing:
Python
Tensorflow
Keras
Matlib
Jupyter

In this specific example, I'll be using the Jupyter Notebook from the "Basic Image Classification with Tensorflow" course at 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-beginner-basic-image-classification/home/info

You can get your completed Jupyter Notebook from https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-beginner-basic-image-classification/resources/GkBBf

You should download the TensorFlow2 notebook: "Notebook_Complete_TF2.zip" [Just right-click on it and Save link as... to a directory on your drive].
Unzip the contents of this file to the directory on your local disk where you will keep everything related to this notebook.
For the purposes of this example, I will create a directory called "Image Classifiction" on my local disk.

We must first download and install this specific Python version:  python-3.9.13-amd64
NOTE:  It may work with v3.10.x as well; however, it will not work with v3.11.x and later.
