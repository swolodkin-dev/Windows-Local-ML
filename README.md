HowTo setup/configure Python ML tools under MS Windows 10

This procedure will allow you to install, setup & configure all the software needed to run a basic Machine Learning framework utilizing:
Python
Keras
Tensorflow
Matlib
Jupyter

In this specific example, I'll be using the Jupyter Notebook from the "Basic Image Classification with Tensorflow" course at https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-beginner-basic-image-classification/home/info
You can get your completed Jupyter Notebook from https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-beginner-basic-image-classification/resources/GkBBf

You should download the TensorFlow2 notebook: "Notebook_Complete_TF2.zip" [Just right-click on it and Save link as... to a directory on your drive].
Unzip the contents of this file to the directory where you will keep everything related to this notebook.
